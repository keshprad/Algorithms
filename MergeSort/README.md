## MergeSort  
_**About**_  
Given a file of integers, this algorithm sorts elements in increasing order in O(nlog(n)) running time.  

---  

_**How it works**_  
1. The algorithm recursively splits the list into two halves until it is of length 1 or less.  

1. After reaching the base case we merge the two halves in increasing order.  

1. We continue merging all halves retracing up the recursive stack until finishing the first call of [sortAndCount(...)]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/7d9f160c63f6bbed509327dc18d49ff418017948/MergeSort/Inversions.py#L17 )

_**Methods**_  
- readFile(f)  
    - Takes in a parameter for _f_, a path to an input file.  
    - Reads the file of integers and appends each integers to the self.res() array.  
- sortAndCount(a)  
    - Takes _a_, a list of integers, as input  
    - Base Case: When array length is less than or equal to 1.  
        - Returns the list.  
    - Recursively calls sortAndCount(...) on the left and right half of the array.  
    - Merges the sorted right and left halves of the array by invoking mergeAndCountSplits(...).  
- mergeAndCountSplits(left, right)  
    - Takes in as input two sorted lists, _left_ and _right_, which are supposed to represent the left-half and right-half arrays.  
    - Since both lists are sorted, in order to merge we take the lowest unvisited element from each list.  
        - The program holds two pointers to the currently inspected elements in _left_ and _right_.  
        - Compares the element at each pointer and chooses the smaller element to append to the resulting 'out' array.  
        - Increments the pointer that pointed to the lower element.

_**Input**_  
The input file describes an array of numbers. It uses the following format:  

\[num1\]  
\[num2\]  
\[num3\]  
...
