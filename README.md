_**Algorithms**_  
- [Dijkstra's Shortest Path]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/DijkstraShortestPath )  
    - This greedy algorithm computes the shortest path from a source vertex to every other vertex in the graph. Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't work as expected with negative edges lengths.  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/DijkstraShortestPath/README.md )  
- [Minimum Completion Time (Weighted Job Scheduling)]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/GreedyJobSchedulingTimes )  
    - A greedy algorithm which figures the optimal order in which and the optimal total time a series of jobs takes based on their weight and length.  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/GreedyJobSchedulingTimes/README.md )  
- [Continuous Streaming Medians Using Heaps]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/HeapMedians )  
    - This algorithm utilizes two heaps to maintain a median as more and more numbers are streamed in.  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/HeapMedians/README.md )  
- [Karatsuba Multiplication]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/KaratsubaMultiplication )  
    - This is a multiplication algorithm that is much quicker than the traditional grade school algorithm which works in quadratic running time.  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/KaratsubaMultiplication/README.md )
- [Karger's Min Cut]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/KargerMinCut )  
    - This randomized algorithm computes the minimum cut of a graph.   
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/KargerMinCut/README.md )  
- [Kasaraju's Strongly Connected Components]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/KasarajuSCC )  
    - Given a directed graph representation, Kasaraju's Algorithm finds the strongly connected components of this graph.  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/KasarajuSCC/README.md )  
- [MergeSort]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/MergeSort )  
    - Given a file of integers, this algorithm sorts elements in increasing order in O(nlog(n)) running time.  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/MergeSort/README.md )  
- [Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/PrimMinSpanningTree )  
    - Given a representation of an undirected graph, this greedy algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree(the edges taken to reach all nodes while minimize the total cost).  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/PrimMinSpanningTree/README.md )  
- [QuickSort]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/QuickSort )  
    - Given a file of integers, this algorithm sorts elements in increasing order in O(nlog(n)) running time.  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/QuickSort/README.md )  
- [Selecting the i-th Order Statistic]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/SelectIthOrderStatistic )  
    - This algorithms finds the i-th order statistic, the i-th smallest number, in a given file of integers.  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/SelectIthOrderStatistic/README.md )  
- [Simple Clustering]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/SimpleClustering )  
    - This is a greedy clustering algorithm that clusters graph data points into k clusters. The algorithm uses user input to determine k.  
    - [Full Documentation]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/blob/master/SimpleClustering/README.md )  
- [Union Find or Disjoint Set]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/UnionFind_DisjointSet )  
    - This data structure makes it easier to represent clustered data points. It has methods to find the cluster header, merge clusters, and optimize the cluster representation using path compression.
