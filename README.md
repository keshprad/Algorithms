I include any algorithms I find interesting, in addition to the Programming Assignments for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms?" target="_blank">Stanford's Algorithms Specialization on Coursera</a>.

Most files for test cases are taken from <a href="https://github.com/beaunus" target="_blank">@beaunus</a>
