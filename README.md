# Algorithms
This repository includes any algorithms I find interesting, in addition to the programming assignments for [Stanford's Algorithms Specialization]( https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms ) on Coursera.

Most files for test cases are used from [@beaunus]( https://github.com/beaunus )'s [stanford-algs]( https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs ) repository or provided by [Stanford's Algorithms Specialization]( https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms ) taught by [Tim Roughgarden]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-roughgarden-1a594855 ) on Coursera.
