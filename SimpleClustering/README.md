## Simple Clustering  
_**About**_  
This is a greedy clustering algorithm that clusters graph data points into k clusters. The algorithm uses user input to determine k.

_**Methods**_  
- readFile(fileName)  
    - Takes in a parameter for a path to the input file _fileName_.
    - Constructs and returns a dictionary of format {cost: edges}.  
    - Constructs and returns a [Union Find data structure]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/UnionFind_DisjointSet ) with all vertices in separate clusters
- findClusters()  
    - Greedily groups data points into clusters.  
    - Starts with the lowest cost edges and if an edge connects vertices that are in different clusters, it will join the clusters by invoking union(...) from the [Union Find data structure]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/UnionFind_DisjointSet ).  
- findSpacing()  
    - Goes through every edge and returns the cost of the shortest edge that spans across multiple clusters.

_**How it works**_  
The algorithm greedily chooses the unvisited edge with the lowest cost and combines its 2 vertices into a cluster. If the vertices are already in clusters, it merges the two clusters; however, if they are in the same cluster, the algorithms skips over the edge.  

The algorithm uses the [Union Find (Disjoint Set)]( https://github.com/keshprad/Algorithms/tree/master/UnionFind_DisjointSet ) to find the cluster's parent, determine if vertices are in the same cluster, and merge clusters.

_**Input**_  
The input file describes a complete graph with edge costs. It uses the following format:  

\[number of nodes\]  
\[edge1_node1\] \[edge1_node2\] \[edge1_cost\]    
\[edge2_node1\] \[edge2_node2\] \[edge2_cost\]  
...
